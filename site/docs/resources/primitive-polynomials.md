title: Default primitive polynomials
---

The table below lists the default primitive polynomials of degree $k$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$ for $k \in [1 : 24]$. The polynomial $p(X)$ is represented as a binary number, where the leftmost bit stands for the highest degree term. For example, the polynomial $p(X) = X^3 + X + 1$ is represented as `0b1011`.
